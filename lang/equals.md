## Info about equals sign choices

Currently no decision has been made about what equals sign variants will be used for what operations. There are some I'm leaning towards though.

There are 4 different operations that require equals signs

##### Assignments:
- Replace (Move right to left, return old left)
- Swap (Move right to left, left to right, return nothing)

##### Comparison:
- Identity (Whether they are the same object)
- Equality (Whether they have the same values)

Here are the planned operators so far:
- Replace `:=`
- Swap `|=`
- Identity `=`
- Equality `==`
