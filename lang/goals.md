Leaf's goals are to be:
- sensible
- clean
- expressive
- safe
- etc

Leaf is currently inspired mainly by Rust, but also by Pony and Java to some extent.
It should have the power and safety of Rust, the expressivity of Rust and Pony, and a runtime like that of Java to allow for some more features in the language (or maybe just to not have to learn about generating native code).
